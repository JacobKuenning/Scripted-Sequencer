# PITCH
    - a midi sequencer you control with a musical scripting language

# DELIVERABLES
    - the script needs to be easier to write then heavily abstracted c++, 
      otherwise there's no point in writing a scripting language
    - it needs to easily interface with midi services, with as little 
      setup as possible
    - needs to run fast enough to support high BPM
    - needs to give error messages when something fails

# IDEAS
    - support for randomization
    - macro support
        - ex: instead of "Channel 1" or "1", you could say that "P" = "Channel 1"
        or "K" = "C1"
    - progressive CC, say that CC will move from value x to value y over this set amount
      of time or steps
        - can be smooth or stepwise
